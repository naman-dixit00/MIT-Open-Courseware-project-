## Overview  
This repository reproduces and extends two neuroscience-inspired computational projects from **MIT OpenCourseWare’s “Brains, Minds, and Machines” (Summer 2015)** program under the research area **“Circuits for Intelligence.”**  
The goal is to bridge biological neural computation and artificial intelligence models through simulation, decoding, and analysis.

## Circuits for Intelligence  
**Based on MIT OpenCourseWare — RES.9-003: Brains, Minds, and Machines (Summer 2015)**  
## Project 2.1 — *What is there? Representations of Visual Information in Neuronal Responses and Computer Vision Models*  

### Instructors  
Gabriel Kreiman, Leyla Isik, Bill Lotter  

### Description  
Understanding the visual world requires constructing internal representations where behaviorally important variables can be easily "read out."  
The brain achieves this via the **ventral visual stream**, transforming visual input into structured neural response patterns.  
In this project, you will explore how **information can be decoded** from both **neural data** and **computer vision models**, and compare the two using machine learning.  

### Subprojects  

#### 2.1.1 — Decoding Object Representations  
- Dataset: A set of single-object images `{p1, …, pN}`  
- Data sources:  
  - Behavioral data  
  - Neurophysiological recordings (humans and monkeys)  
  - Computational model outputs (HMAX and/or CNNs)  
- Objective:  
  - Use machine learning classifiers to decode and discriminate objects based on single-trial data.  
  - Compare performance between biological and artificial representations.  

#### 2.1.2 — Tolerance to Transformations  
- Study **object recognition robustness** under transformations such as:  
  - Scale  
  - Position  
  - Viewpoint  

#### 2.1.3 — Cross-Domain Comparison  
- Compare results across:  
  - Behavioral experiments  
  - Neurophysiological data  
  - Computational model predictions

## Project 2.2 — *The Role of STDP in Neural Networks*  

### Instructors  
Gabriel Kreiman, Joseph Olson  

### Description  
**Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)** is a key biological mechanism driving neural learning and circuit formation.  
It refines the Hebbian learning rule — *“neurons that fire together wire together.”*  
This project investigates, through simulation, how different biologically observed STDP rules shape network connectivity and function.  

### Objectives  
- Implement various STDP learning rules (LTP/LTD).  
- Explore how timing differences between pre- and post-synaptic firing affect synaptic weights.  
- Simulate and analyze how heterogeneous STDP rules produce distinct local network architectures.  
- Relate emergent circuit structures to cognitive functions observed in biological systems.  

### Core Concepts  
- **LTP (Long-Term Potentiation):** Strengthening when pre-synaptic firing precedes post-synaptic.  
- **LTD (Long-Term Depression):** Weakening when firing order is reversed.  
- **Biological Variants:** Region-specific or dendrite-specific STDP patterns.
